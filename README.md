# WasteConnect

WasteConnect is a web application that connects users with companies specializing in the collection and upcycling of waste materials. Users can easily upload information about the type and quantity of waste they have, and companies can view this information on a map, allowing for efficient collection and upcycling processes.
WasteConnect revolutionizes waste management by providing an innovative platform for efficient and sustainable waste collection and upcycling. Traditional waste management often involves inefficient collection processes and limited recycling efforts. WasteConnect addresses these challenges by connecting users directly with companies that specialize in upcycling waste materials. This approach not only helps in reducing landfill waste but also promotes the concept of circular economy where waste is viewed as a valuable resource that can be reused and repurposed. Through WasteConnect, waste materials such as paper, metal, and plastic are collected from various sources, including households and businesses, and are upcycled into new products, reducing the environmental impact of waste disposal and contributing to a cleaner, greener planet.
